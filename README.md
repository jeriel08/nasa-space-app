# NASA Space App
### Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine


## Getting Started with Docker Compose

Build and start the full stack (frontend and backend) using:

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

- The backend will be available on port 8000.
- The frontend will be available on the port specified in your `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., 5173).
